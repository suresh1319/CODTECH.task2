Score Calculation: The user’s score is calculated in real-time, based on the number of correct answers.
Answer Review: After completing the quiz, the user can see a review of each question, their selected answer, and the correct answer, along with color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for wrong).
Responsive Design: The app has a modern, responsive design suitable for different screen sizes and provides a smooth and engaging experience.
